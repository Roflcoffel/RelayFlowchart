# RelayFlowchart
RelayFlowchart website for swedish A, B and CD complexes.

TODO:
- generate the index.html based on which complex is selected, data is in the respective json file.
- maybe convert to a jekyll project
- add a tabnav to change complex
- depending on the trains position highlight in the flowchart what happens.
- add the B and A complexes.
